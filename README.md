# Create a photo website

Copy this repository and run ```npm install``` in the installation folder.
1. Copy all photos into the installation folder's ```/photos``` folder.
2. In a terminal with the current directory set to the installation folder, run the command ```npm process-photos``` and it will resize the photos and record Exif information from the original photo and strip out all Exif information from the resized photo while writing it out to ```/src/assets/photos```.
3. Run the development version of the Astro website with the command ```npm run dev```.
